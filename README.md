A client/server system that supports "town baggers" who are visiting all the towns of Vermont
(and eventually other states). The client program is, essentially, a journaling application with
some social media-like features. The backend server holds a repository of all the visitation
artifacts created by all users. Ultimately this program is intended to serve the needs of the
251 Club of Vermont and, thus, connect to the 251 Club's backend. However, for ease of
development, it is currently being implemented independently of the 251 Club.

See the files in the `doc` folder for more information about the system.
